* [2018-4-11 Wed] Now, it can work with multilingual.
After installing ~i18n-page-texts~ 
, writing a provider ~page-texts.service.ts~
and subscribing its observable from ~app.component.ts~,
I can update its sentences with different languages.

The bash command sample is shown below.
#+begin_src sh
npm run i18n
;; do some modifications in assets/i18n/...
ng serve
#+end_src
* [2018-03-03 Sat] Submit to AppSource. 

* [2018-01-09 Tue] Install *@angular/cli*, *yo* and *@types/office-js*
  1. Following the tutorial shown in [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/quickstarts/excel-quickstart-angular][Quick Start]], [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/develop/add-ins-with-angular2][Develop Add-in]] and [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/testing/create-a-network-shared-folder-catalog-for-task-pane-and-content-add-ins][How to sideload]]. Be careful, ~</br>~ will cause an error. It should be ~<br/>~.
  2. Well, to avoid =git= transfering =LF= to be =CRLF= which can be easily set in =VSCode=, you can fix it by adding =[core] autocrlf=false= into file /.git\/config/ to turn off this functionality. It was discussed in [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1967370/git-replacing-lf-with-crlf][this StackOverflow post]].
